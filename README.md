# steam-navigator
A front end AngularJS web application for viewing the Steam Store

To run the local dev server at http://localhost:8080, run `npm install`, then `node server.js`.

For Chrome in a dev environment, I use [this extension][https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi] to deal with CORS for AJAX requests.

Uses the [Steam Store web API][https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI].
